# Welcome to Vanilla Fusion!
## What is this?

A vanilla-_focused_ mod for Balatro currently featuring 30 jokers and 3 spectral cards. Balance, theming, and 'non-clutter' are heavily considered, open to balancing suggestions, still a WIP 

## What's _in_ this?

Vanilla Fusion is structured as an 'à la carte' mod. If there is a particular part of the mod you don't like or don't want to see, just delete its file. Just make sure to delete any associated patches as well. 

Here's a rundown of everything currently implemented (most of them do _not_ have art yet as I am a terrible artist)

## Why is this?

I started making this mod on a whim when I learned you could access Balatro's source code with almost no effort. Unfortunately, I fell in love with LUA (I've never touched it before) and Balatro's source code, so I decided to just keep adding stuff as long as I was having fun! 

## How is this?

When I started VF, I didn't know there were many Balatro mods out there. I had only ever heard of Cryptid, and that wasn't my speed. Still, I decided to ignore other mods and ideas from Reddit, hoping to come up with my own unique ideas that others weren't implementing. The only resources I used were the SMODS wiki, occasional Discord questions, and even rarer peeks at Cryptid source code. I _hope_ this has led to some ideas the community has not seen before. If not, oh well. I still had fun.

My philosophy for this mod is to only add things that give the game value, and more stuff =/= value. I totally understand the appeal of just putting stuff in the game, but when I start a run, I don't want every joker I come across to be silly, useless, or hyperspecific. Even jokers that are fun, interesting, or useful don't necessarily add _value_ to the game if there's just _too much stuff_ (you'll see a few jokers in the Outdated folder that fit this. I've decided to let them be public if anyone is interested, and I expect this folder to grow over time). 

I will say I did quite a bit of lovely patching with this mod, so I'm not sure how well it will play with other mods. 

Let me also say I am not an artist, and none of these jokers have art yet :( Except for one, which I was fairly proud of.

## What's next?

I would like to get feedback and testing for these cards and, if they feel right, complete them with art. I'm not sure who to reach out to for art, if you are interested or know someone who might be interested, please message me!

I am also open to suggestions for tweaks, changes, or completely new ideas. I intentionally made some of the jokers rather good, and others rather meh, because that's how vanilla works. Some cards are always on the 'take' list, some are circumstantial, and some are almost always a pass unless in a really specific scenario. Some are better toward the beginning of the game to help you get on your feet, others are only good near the boss blind. You get the idea, and I think that's how it _should_ be. :)

# Welcome to Vanilla Fusion!
## What is this?

A vanilla-esque mod for Balatro currently featuring 30 jokers and 1 spectral card.

## Why is this?

I started making this mod on a whim when I learned you could access Balatro's source code with almost no effort. Unfortunately, I fell in love with LUA (I've never touched it before) and Balatro's source code, so I decided to just keep adding stuff as long as I was having fun! 

## How is this?

When I started VF, I didn't know there were many Balatro mods out there. I had only ever heard of Cryptid, and that wasn't my speed. Still, I decided to ignore other mods and ideas from Reddit, hoping to come up with my own unique ideas that others weren't implementing. The only resources I used were the SMODS wiki, occasional Discord questions, and even rarer peeks at Cryptid source code. I _hope_ this has led to some ideas the community has not seen before. If not, oh well. I still had fun.

I will say I did quite a bit of lovely patching with this mods, so I'm not sure how well it will play with other mods.

Let me also say I am not an artist, and none of these jokers have art yet :(

## What's next?

I would like to get feedback and testing for these cards and, if they pass the small test, complete them with art. I'm not sure who to reach out to for art, if you are interested or know someone who might be interested, please message me!

I am also open to suggestions for tweaks, changes, or completely new ideas. That being said, I'm only interested in feedback relating to _how fun_ these jokers are. Basically, are they fun enough to be in the game at all? Balancing things, like "this card is too powerful or not powerful enough," I'm not too concerned about. I intentionally made some of them rather good, and others rather meh because that's how vanilla works. Some cards are always on the 'take' list, some are circumstantial, and some are almost always a pass unless in a really specific scenario. Some are better toward the beginning of the game to help you get on your feet, others are only good near the boss blind. You get the idea, and I think that's how it _should_ be. :)
